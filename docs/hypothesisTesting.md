Hypothesis testing
==================

Steps
-----

1) Define the Problem
2) State the Objectives
3) Establish the Hypothesis (left-tailed, right-tailed, or two tailed test).
4) State the Null Hypothesis (Ho)
5) State the Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)
6) Select the appropriate statistical test
7) State the Alpha Risk level
8) State the Beta Risk level
9) Establish the Effect Size
10) Create Sampling Plan, determine sample size
11) Gather samples
12) Collect and record data
	Normality plot
13) Calculate the test statistic
14) Determine the p-value

If p-Value is < than alpha-risk, reject Ho and accept Ha
If p-Value is > than alpha-risk, fail to reject the Null, Ho
