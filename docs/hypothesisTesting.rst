Hypothesis Testing
==================

Steps
-----

Define the Problem
..................
The first step is to clearly define what we want to test and how we want to test it
We then clearly define the variables that will be used

Establish the Hypothesis
........................
(left-tailed, right-tailed, or two tailed test)
Left Tail test
    Parameter < given value
Right Tail test
    Parameter > given value
Two tailed test
    Parameter doesn’t equal value

In formulating a one sided hypothesis, we need to remember that rejecting Ho is always a strong conclusion. So we should put the statement that is important in the alternative hypothesis.
 
State the Hypotheses
..............................
State the Null and Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)
- Null Hypothesis (Ho): An hypothesis associated with a contradiction to a theory we want to prove
- Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): An hypothesis associated with a theory we want to prove


Select the appropriate statistical test
.......................................
parametric vs non parametric
parametric test when:
- Normally distributed data
- sample size is large enough to satisfy central limit theorem

.. NOTE::
    We can use a parametric test on non gaussian data, but we will reduce statistical power


State the desired Alpha and Beta
................................
+-----------+--------------+---------------+
|           | H0 is True   | Ha is True    |
+-----------+--------------+---------------+
| Accept H0 | good         | Type II Error |
+-----------+--------------+---------------+
| Reject H0 | Type I Error | good          |
+-----------+--------------+---------------+

Alpha, Significance level
    Probability of type I error






Establish the Effect Size
..........................
asd

Create Sampling Plan, determine sample size
...........................................
asd

Collect and record data
.......................
asd

Check the tests assumptions, Normality plot
............................................
asd

Calculate the test statistic
............................
- Test Statistic: Value calculated from a sample often to summarize the sample


Determine the p-value
.....................
P-value
    - Smallest level of significance that would lead to a rejection of Ho with the given data.
    - Probability of wrongly rejecting Ho. Small p-value indicates strong evidence against Ho

If p-Value is < than alpha-risk, reject Ho and accept Ha

If p-Value is > than alpha-risk, fail to reject the Null, Ho
