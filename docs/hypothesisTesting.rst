Hypothesis testing
==================

Steps
-----

Define the Problem
    The first step is to clearly define what we want to test and how we want to test it
    We then clearly define the variables that will be used

Establish the Hypothesis (left-tailed, right-tailed, or two tailed test)


State the Null Hypothesis (Ho)

State the Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)

Select the appropriate statistical test

State the Alpha Risk level

State the Beta Risk level

Establish the Effect Size

Create Sampling Plan, determine sample size

Gather samples

Collect and record data

Normality plot

Calculate the test statistic

Determine the p-value


If p-Value is < than alpha-risk, reject Ho and accept Ha

If p-Value is > than alpha-risk, fail to reject the Null, Ho
