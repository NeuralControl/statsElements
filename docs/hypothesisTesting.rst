Hypothesis testing
==================

Steps
-----

1) Define the Problem
The first step is to clearly define what we want to test and how we want to test it
We then clearly define the variables that will be used

2) Establish the Hypothesis (left-tailed, right-tailed, or two tailed test)

4) State the Null Hypothesis (Ho)
5) State the Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)
6) Select the appropriate statistical test
7) State the Alpha Risk level
8) State the Beta Risk level
9) Establish the Effect Size
10) Create Sampling Plan, determine sample size
11) Gather samples
12) Collect and record data
	Normality plot
13) Calculate the test statistic
14) Determine the p-value

If p-Value is < than alpha-risk, reject Ho and accept Ha
If p-Value is > than alpha-risk, fail to reject the Null, Ho
