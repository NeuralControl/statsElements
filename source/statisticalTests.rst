    QQ plot of random normal data against a normal distribution



To get an indication on the shape of a distribution, or to compare to a given distribution,
we can plot a histogram or a QQ-plot (quantile-quantile).
When plotting a QQ-plot against a normal distribution, if all the samples fall close to the reference line, we can assume normality.
